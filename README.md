The digital and physical tools available to manage businesses are geared toward the needs and tastes of the white collar world. Blue collar entrepreneurs are forced to choose between complex desktop tools and overly niche products that don't refelect the many hats they wear.&#x20;

Physical products to assist with administration and accounting and pair with apps are simply not available. This is causing millions of American and Canadian small business owners to stumble and stall in their growth.
