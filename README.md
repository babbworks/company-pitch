# Babb Works

#### We're based in Hamilton, the northern capital of the Rust Belt.

Our products help individuals and small teams stay productive.

Our goal is to spread throughout the region and far beyond, giving voice to the needs and aspirations of blue collar society. The tools and technologies that succeed in these communities demand extreme simplicity and durability. [Workpads](products/workpads.md) is our first product.

We are committed to proving that these types of solutions can have massive impact across whole economies, bringing disruption to business administration at all levels.
