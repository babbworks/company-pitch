# Why Babb?

The digital and physical tools available to manage businesses are geared toward the needs and tastes of the white collar world. Blue collar entrepreneurs are forced to choose between complex desktop tools and overly niche products that don't refelect the many hats they wear.&#x20;

The "team subscription" model has never worked for the majority of independent tradesmen and their dynamic teams. Physical products to assist with administration and accounting are simply not available. This is causing millions of American and Canadian small business owners to stumble and stall in their growth. The continental economy itself is behind held back by this inability of small firms to grow sales and  increase output.

Disrupition is the emergence of market-creating innovations that enable excluded populations to participate using simple, affordable and powerful products.

By leverging the working world's immediate demands for mobile-first business software and hardware, we can amplify economic activity while changing what it means to administer and manage enterprises. Our Blue Ocean is based on the methods and mentalities of blue collar communities at the lowest levels, where jobs, staff and responsibilities constantly change, demanding solutions that reflect reality.
