# Babb Works

We're based in Hamilton, the northern capital of the Rust Belt.

Our tools help individuals and small teams stay productive.

Our goal is to spread throughout the region and beyond, giving voice to the needs and aspirations of blue collar society. The tools and technologies that succeed in these communities demand durability and simplicity. We are committed to proving that these same solutions can have massive impact across whole economies.
