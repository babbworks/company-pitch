# Why Babb?

The digital and physical tools available to manage businesses are geared toward the needs and tastes of the white collar world. Blue collar entrepreneurs are forced to choose between complex desktop tools and overly niche products that don't refelect the many hats they wear.&#x20;

The "team subscription" model has never worked for the majority of independent tradesmen and their dynamic teams. Physical products to assist with administration and accounting are simply not available. This is causing millions of American and Canadian small business owners to stumble and stall in their growth. The continental economy itself is being held back.

**Disrupition is the emergence of market-creating innovations that enable excluded populations to participate using simple, affordable and powerful products. This shifts the playing field forever.**

By leverging the working world's immediate demands for mobile-first software and hardware, we can amplify economic activity while redefining what it means to administer and manage enterprises. Our Blue Ocean is based on the methods and mentalities of blue collar communities at the lowest levels, where jobs, staff and responsibilities constantly shift.&#x20;

As software margins deteriorate, this market's enthusiasm for personal and cheap hardware opens up a long-term demand in the Americas and globally that our brands will be unquely well-positioned to serve.&#x20;

We will seize these opportunities be operating like a media company and using our reach to tell respected and trusted stories about the people and places on the front lines of survival and the reindustrialization period we are now entering.
